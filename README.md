Thanks for checking out this repository.

Each project shown on the YouTube channel has its own folder here, containing the files used in that specific video (code, schematics, CAD models, notes, or assets where applicable).

This repo is intended as a reference for viewers rather than a step-by-step guide. Files are provided as-is.
